# Personal Projects Portfolio

I'm Nikhil Dutta, a Virginia Tech student double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics, interested in data analytics and machine learning. I enjoy building data-driven models and applying statistical techniques to extract actionable insights from real-world datasets.

This repository serves as an index of my personal projects. Each project includes its own dedicated README explaining the problem, approach, and results.
